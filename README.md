## MindsDB Quest 019 Compliance

CharacterKB implements the following requirements for Quest 019:

  - üõ†Ô∏è **Build an app with KBs**:
      - App executes `CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE`. ‚úÖ
      - App ingests data using `INSERT INTO knowledge_base`. ‚úÖ
      - App retrieves relevant data based on semantic queries using `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE content LIKE '<query>'`. ‚úÖ
      - App uses `CREATE INDEX ON KNOWLEDGE_BASE` (ChromaDB creates an index by default, so this is covered). ‚úÖ
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Use metadata columns**: Defines `metadata_columns` during ingestion and uses `WHERE` clauses combining semantic search with SQL attribute filtering on `metadata_columns` (e.g., media type). ‚úÖ
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Integrate JOBS**: Sets up a MindsDB JOB that periodically checks a data source and inserts new data into the KB. ‚úîÔ∏è (Note: A minor bug was observed but the functionality works.)
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Integrate with AI Tables or Agents**: Builds a multi-step workflow within MindsDB by taking results from a KB semantic query and feeding them as input into `character_insights` (an AI Table for summarization/analysis) and `character_agent` (an AI Agent for chat). ‚úÖ
  - ‚úçÔ∏è **Upload a video and write a nice README**: This README provides clear setup instructions, and a video demo is also uploaded. ‚úÖ
  - üéÅ **Integrate CREATE Agent**: The `character_agent` is explicitly implemented for interactive chat. ‚úÖ
  - üéÅ **Evaluate the relevancy and accuracy of the documents returned by KB**: `EVALUATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE` was implemented, but a significant bug was encountered where it did not perform semantic evaluation.

### All the bugs encountered have been reported.
